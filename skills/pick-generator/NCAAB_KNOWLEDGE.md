# NCAAB Betting Knowledge

## Home Court

- **Home court is huge (~4-5 points)** — Much bigger factor than NBA due to hostile environments
- **Cameron Crazies, Phog Allen, etc.** — Elite home courts can add even more value
- **Road teams in conference play struggle** — Familiarity breeds contempt

## Spreads

- **Ranked vs unranked blowouts often don't cover big spreads** — Teams take foot off gas
- **Spreads 20+ are dangerous** — Hard to cover, garbage time happens
- **Conference play is more predictable than early season** — Teams know each other

## Travel & Scheduling

- **Travel and timezone matter more than NBA** — College kids affected more by travel
- **Non-conference games are more volatile** — Less film, unfamiliar opponents
- **Mid-week games after weekend road trips** — Fatigue factor

## Team Factors

- **Freshman-heavy teams** — More inconsistent, especially early season
- **Senior leadership** — Experienced teams handle pressure better
- **Tempo mismatches** — When fast team meets slow team, watch the total
