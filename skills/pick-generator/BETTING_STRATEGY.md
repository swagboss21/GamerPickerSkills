# Betting Strategy Principles

## Core Philosophy

- **Look for value, not just winners** — A 60% chance bet at +150 is better than 55% at -150
- **The line is the market's opinion** — You need a reason to disagree, not just a hunch
- **Passing on a game is fine** — Don't force picks; no edge = no bet

## Line Movement & Public Action

- **Fade heavy public action when line hasn't moved** — If 80% public on one side but line steady, sharps are on other side
- **Respect reverse line movement** — Line moving opposite of public money indicates sharp action
- **Early line value** — Best prices often available when lines first open

## Spread Guidance

- **Big spreads (20+) are hard to cover** — Favorites often coast, backdoor covers common
- **Key numbers in NFL matter less in basketball** — But 3, 7 still somewhat relevant
- **Buy low on teams after bad losses** — Overreaction creates value

## Confidence Calibration

- **Most picks should be medium confidence** — This is your bread and butter
- **High confidence is rare** — Max 1-2 per day; multiple factors must align
- **Low confidence = barely worth betting** — Consider passing instead

## Bankroll Mindset

- **Flat betting is safest** — Same amount on every pick
- **Don't chase losses** — Stick to your process
- **Long-term thinking** — One day doesn't matter; 100 picks does
