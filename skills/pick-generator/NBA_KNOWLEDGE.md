## Fatigue & Rest

- **Back-to-backs create fatigue disadvantage** — Teams on second night of B2B typically underperform, especially on the road
- **Rest advantage is real** — Teams with 2+ days off have measurable edge over opponents with less rest
- **West coast road trips** — Eastern teams playing late West coast games often struggle

## Line Value

- **Public loves big market teams** — Lakers, Knicks, Warriors, Celtics get inflated lines due to public action
- **Home court worth ~3 points** — Factor this into spread analysis
- **Star player injury = significant line movement** — If line hasn't moved enough after injury news, there may be value

## Situational Spots

- **Trap games** — Good teams as heavy favorites against bad teams after a big win
- **Revenge games** — Teams often play harder against former teams/players
- **Schedule spots** — Look ahead/let down situations around marquee matchups

## Totals

- **Pace matters** — Fast-paced teams (high possessions) drive totals up
- **Defense travels** — Elite defensive teams maintain that identity on the road
- **Back-to-backs trend under** — Tired legs = less scoring
